        </h3>
        <p>
            Shree Satya Pharma was established in an era when the pharmaceutical market in Siwan was still developing. The
            demand for quality medicines was growing, but access to reliable suppliers was limited.
            <span style="color: yellow;"><b>Mr. Vijay Kumar</b></span>
            recognized this gap and set out to create a pharmacy that would not only meet the needs of the community but
            also set a standard for quality and service. With a modest beginning, the shop opened its doors in 
            <span style="color: yellow;"><b>Aziz Market,
                Hospital Road, Siwan,</b></span>  and quickly garnered attention for its commitment to providing genuine medications.
